This dir will contain configuration files.

In development this is at the <source top>/config dir and contains what I need for development.
In production this will be where ever I put the production configs for xeduler.

The code will refer to this dir via the environment variable
XEDULER_CONFIG_DIR

lisp contents in this dir will not be compiled, they will be loaded in appropriate places by the code at runtime
