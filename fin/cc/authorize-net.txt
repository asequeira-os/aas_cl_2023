x_relay_response FALSE
x_delim_data TRUE
x_delim_char single char

** other fields

x_card_code CCV number
x_test_request TRUE to treat transaction as test
x_duplicate_window some number between 0 and 28800. seconds to block duplicates

* response fields
Response Code 1 = Approved
 2 = Declined
 3 = Error
 4 = Held for Review
see pp 37 for the rest


* dev notes
create invoice number
ask paying customers for their company name
pick x_delim_char dynamically to ensure no conflict with data?
but they allow for x_encap_char to quote
need to store authorization code received
need to store transaction ID
when duplicate is detected the payment gateway response will contain the response code of 3 (processing error) with a response reason code of 11 (duplicate transaction). additional details will be present only if transaction included x_duplicate_window
response fields are by position. use 3.1 and see table for field numbers
need to design for this

do not pass on reason text for denial until proper filtering is in place
need to store response code and response reason code to understand/diagnoze. see pp47

new accounts are placed in test mode by default

live testing can be done by making a small 0.01 amount transaction and quickly going to the 'unsettled transactions' page on the 'merchant interface' and voiding them
visa veification might allows 0.00 amount

test data use CC number 4222222222222
set amount to the response reason code you would like to produce
For example, to test the AVS response reason code number 27, submit the test transaction with the credit card number “4222222222222” and the amount “27.00.”
It is not possible to test the AVS or CCV responses in the developer test environment.need to use the real trans and 'unsettled transactions' page.

* implementation ideas
create gateway vendors and config data for each vendor
have a generic interface definition
implement it for Virtual Merchant
