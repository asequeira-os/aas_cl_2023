looking at

need to collect address and zip code
says should not store CVV info

basic data - card number, expiration date, amount
need customer address and billing address

see follow on transactions pp 17 (seems to allow non sale only)




* integration
allows https
process.do is the key/value format
allows get and post
** test account
see pp 22 for getting test account
internetproductsupport@merchantconnect.com
they need : Company Name Primary Contact Name Primary Contact Phone Primary E-mail Address
they give VID, user ID and user password
admin terminal at
https://demo.myvirtualmerchant.com/VirtualMerchantDemo/login.do
VID keeps transactions separated by integrator
Integrator can then retrieve a unique PIN that can be used to send transactions via the API
Each account can have one Merchant Admin user and can have multiple Employee Users, who may or may not have access to run transactions.

ssl_txn_id transaction number
ssl_show_form false (unless I want them to collect info on their site)

* security notes
From pp 79/71
"Setting up HTTP Referrers in the Administration website tells Virtual Merchant to only accept transactions from a pre-approved list of websites."
means I should set this up and send that as the 'referrer' http header
make sure this is a funny url that no one can duplicate on a customer browser
Auto Pend â€“ We recommend that you use the Auto-Pend feature for any account that is set to Auto-Settle
create normal a/c for day to day use and use admin a/c sparingly
Log payment application activity.
Cardholder data must never be stored on a server connected to the Internet.



* acronyms
PIN personal identification number
CVV/CSC/CVD/CVV2/CVVC/CCV card security/verification code (code value)(data)
AVS Address verification system (card holders billing address)
** transaction types
CCSALE credit card sale transaction
CCAUTHONLY Auth Only
CCAVSONLY AVS Only
